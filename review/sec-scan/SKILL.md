# Security Scan Skill

Audit your Claude Code configuration for security issues using [AgentShield](https://github.com/affaan-m/agentshield).

## When to Activate

- Setting up a new Claude Code project
- After modifying `.claude/settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, or MCP configs
- Before committing configuration changes
- When onboarding to a new repository with existing Claude Code configs
- Periodic security hygiene checks

## What It Scans

| File | Checks |
|------|--------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Hardcoded secrets, auto-run instructions, prompt injection patterns |
| `settings.json` | Overly permissive allow lists, missing deny lists, dangerous bypass flags |
| `mcp.json` | Risky MCP servers, hardcoded env secrets, npx supply chain risks |
| `hooks/` | Command injection via interpolation, data exfiltration, silent error suppression |
| `agents/*.md` | Unrestricted tool access, prompt injection surface, missing model specs |

## Severity Levels

| Grade | Score | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| A | 90-100 | Secure configuration |
| B | 75-89 | Minor issues |
| C | 60-74 | Needs attention |
| D | 40-59 | Significant risks |
| F | 0-39 | Critical vulnerabilities |

## Interpreting Results

### Critical Findings (fix immediately)
- Hardcoded API keys or tokens in config files
- `Bash(*)` in the allow list (unrestricted shell access)
- Command injection in hooks via `${file}` interpolation
- Shell-running MCP servers

### High Findings (fix before production)
- Auto-run instructions in CLAUDE.md (prompt injection vector)
- Missing deny lists in permissions
- Agents with unnecessary Bash access

### Medium Findings (recommended)
- Silent error suppression in hooks (`2>/dev/null`, `|| true`)
- Missing PreToolUse security hooks
- `npx -y` auto-install in MCP server configs
